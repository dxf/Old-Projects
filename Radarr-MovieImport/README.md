e# Radarr-MovieImport
Imports movies to Radarr based from a TXT file.

# How?
- Add a directory to Radarr, where you want your movies to be stored.
- Download the script.
- Create a file called movies.txt.
- Name all of your titles in it. **ONE FOR EACH LINE!**
- Run the script.
- Radarr should then detect the movies in low quality, and download new ones based on your quality preferences.

# Thanks!
